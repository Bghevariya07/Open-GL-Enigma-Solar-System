# OpenGL Enigma Solar System

## Overview

OpenGL Enigma Solar System is a 3D graphical simulation of the solar system developed using **OpenGL**. This project visually demonstrates the motion of planets, their orbits, rotations, and relative positions, offering an interactive and visually engaging representation of our solar system. It’s a great example of applying computer graphics concepts such as transformations, lighting, and camera manipulation.
